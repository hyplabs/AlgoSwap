## TODO

- Test cases
- Anti-frontrunning using hashed commitments: in one block you must commit to making a trade by putting down a deposit (the amount needs to be thought out to properly align incentives), in a later block you would follow through on the commitment by actually making a trade, you can't make a trade unless you've committed to it in a previous block, this should entirely prevent frontrunning bots
