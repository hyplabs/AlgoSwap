    This smart contract implements the Validator part of the AlgoSwap DEX.
    It asserts the existence of all required transaction fields in every
    transaction part of every possible atomic transaction group that AlgoSwap
    supports (Swap Token 1 for Token 2, Swap Token 2 for Token 1, Add Liquidity,
    Withdraw Liquidity, Withdraw Protocol Fees, and Refund).

    Any atomic transaction group MUST have a transaction to the validator
    smart contract as the first transaction of the group to proceed.

    Commands:
        s1  Swap Token 1 for Token 2 in a liquidity pair
        s2  Swap Token 2 for Token 1 in a liquidity pair
        a   Add liquidity to a liquidity pool
        w   Withdraw liquidity from a liquidity pool
        r   Get a refund of unused tokens
        p   Withdraw protocol fees (Developer only)
